            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170438:3"/> better reception of it in an after age, may be a friendly office.</p>
            <p>Such as obſerve <hi>no form</hi> do frequently in ſacred adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fall into impertinencies, where each <hi>Miniſter</hi> takes <hi>his own,</hi> there cannot but be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of thoſe performances, in ſeveral congregations, and the refuſing to ſubmit <hi>to any but our own,</hi> argues a too <hi>much</hi> valuing of our ſelves, and too <hi>little</hi> of that humility and lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of minde which beſt becomes the Miniſters of the Goſpel. The framing of a <hi>new Liturgy</hi> (which ſome of both parties have been attempting) will not
<pb facs="tcp:170438:4"/> attain its deſired end, by the preſent much lamented diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between them, that what the one ſhall <hi>commend</hi> the other will <hi>diſlike:</hi> and an equal mixture of a <hi>new</hi> compoſure with the <hi>old,</hi> will be but as the <hi>putting of a new piece to an old Garment,</hi> whereby the <hi>rent will be the worſe;</hi> ſo that there can be no ſuch probable way of healing up the breach among us in this particular, as by ſome prudent <hi>conſideration</hi> of that which was framed by our fore-fathers, and with which moſt of us have been educated, for which ſubmitting one to another in <hi>circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170438:4"/> we have the examples of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is ſome evidence, ſuch are the <hi>ſtronger in knowledge</hi> on either ſide, who upon this exigency are the moſt apt to yield in them, and thoſe the <hi>weaker</hi> that ſtand moſt upon them, rather hazarding the <hi>ſhipwrack</hi> of the whole, then permit the caſting over-board ſome goods of the <hi>leaſt value: zeal</hi> is an excellent vertue, but without a <hi>bridle</hi> may run the perſon headlong upon dangerous inconveniences, as there extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is to be condemned, who will have <hi>none</hi> of the old at
<pb facs="tcp:170438:5"/> all; ſo is theirs not juſtifiable, who will have <hi>all (i. e.</hi> every particular rite and circumſtance) <hi>or none,</hi> a moderation between both is the more prudential.</p>
            <p>In this book is the <hi>matter</hi> of the whole, only with ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the <hi>form, method,</hi> and diſpenſing with a few <hi>cauſeleſly</hi> offenſive paſſages. Many <hi>ſhort</hi> prayers found in the ſame <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> or adminiſtration, (for which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> commends the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Liturgies) and others prudently appointed for ſome ſpecial dayes, and <hi>annual</hi> commemorations are here (with the ſeveral <hi>Exhortatives)</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:170438:5"/> ſatisfaction of a very <hi>weak ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> drawn into one body. And if the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> do appear once in each, I ſuppoſe it will be judged very convenient, by which, with the <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> (in the old form conſtantly repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) the fundamentals of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were preſerved in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of the vulgar, which, by theſe late years neglect have been almoſt worn out of them, and in the <hi>younger</hi> ſort (who have never, or very rarely heard of them) there is found a groſſer ignorance then in the <hi>elder.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170438:6"/>
            <p> This <hi>caveat</hi> is only entred, that if the <hi>Reader</hi> do ſometimes meet with an exchange or omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any <hi>rite</hi> or <hi>clauſe</hi> in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him not conclude them to be removed by a <hi>writ of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> but be looked upon as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent honourable</hi> perſons, offering themſelves to die for the <hi>peace</hi> of their Country. And as the aime of all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ought to be for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of that <hi>Primitive</hi> union, when the Church was of <hi>one heart and one ſoul:</hi> ſo it will be the prudence of us, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our judgements are ſtill firm for the <hi>old form, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170438:6"/> 
               <hi>the leaſt alteration)</hi> to ſhew it in our meekneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance accordingly for that end: It being one of the beſt evidences of a <hi>true ſon of the Church of England,</hi> to be willing to bear with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what croſs to his <hi>own</hi> opinion, for the peace of his <hi>Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, moſt of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following were drawn up by the <hi>Author</hi> long agoe for a <hi>private</hi> uſe, and though they be now <hi>printed,</hi> (which was deſired by ſuch whoſe judgements are ſufficiently known to be for the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,)</hi> yet in regard the
<pb facs="tcp:170438:7"/> principal <hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> are ſtil too frequently ſo confin'd, it is poſſible they may not tranſgreſs that intended limit of them: and the <hi>experimental</hi> accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they found then with the moderate ſort of both parties in the <hi>hearing,</hi> gives the like probability now in the <hi>reading.</hi> Howſoever being thus barely preſented without any preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous propoſal for the <hi>publick</hi> uſe, as a <hi>copy</hi> for others to write after, I know no cauſe of <hi>cenſure</hi> it can incur in the publiſhing, unleſs it be for obſerving that advice of St. <hi>Paul, Let your moderation be known unto all men.</hi>

                     <p>O Moſt holy Lord God, ſeeing we hear, that what is recorded in holy Scripture of thy Apoſtles and Saints, was written for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and imitation; give us grace ſo to be followers of them, as they were of thy Son Chriſt Jeſus. Thou didſt incline the heart of thy Apoſtle <hi>Andrew,</hi> that he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obeyed the calling of thy Son, and followed him without delay; grant unto us all, that we being called by thy holy word, may forthwith give over our ſelves, obediently to follow thy holy Commandments. And as thou didſt confirm the faith of <hi>Thomas</hi> thy Apoſtle, whom thou didſt ſuffer to be doubtful of thy Sons reſurrection; ſo grant unto us, that we may ſo perfectly, and without all doubt believe in thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, that our faith in thy ſight may never be reproved. And as thou didſt chuſe thy

And ſeeing thou haſt inſtructed thy Church with heavenly doctrine in thy Goſpel, by the labour and care of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the other Evangeliſts, give us grace, that we be not like children carried away with every blaſt of vain doctrine, but finally be eſtabliſhed in the truth of thy holy Goſpel: and grant us perfectly to know thy Son Jeſus Chriſt to be the way, the truth, and the life; whom truly to know is everlaſting life; as thou haſt taught <hi>Philip</hi> and the other Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>And, O Lord, as thou didſt earneſtly command thy Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> to feed thy flock, make we beſeech thee all Biſhops and Paſtors, diligently to preach thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word, and the people obediently to follow the ſame, that they may receive the crown of everlaſting glory: And as thy holy Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> leaving his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and all that he had without delay, was obedient to the calling of thy Son
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170438:19"/> Jeſus Chriſt, and followed him; ſo, we forſaking all wordly and carnal affections, may be evermore ready to follow thy commandements, that as he preached what he was taught from thee, ſo we may believe what he preached, and love what we do believe. And let the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Matthew,</hi> who readily obeyed thy bleſſed Sons call from the receipt of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, to be an Apoſtle and Evangeliſt, be our imitation, in forſaking all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſires and inordinate love of riches, and to follow thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for ever. Grant us to love our enemies by the example of thy Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> who prayed for his perſecutors; and caſt thy bright beams of light upon thy Church, that it being lightned by the doctrine of thy Apoſtle and Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> may attain to thy everlaſting gifts. And ſeeing we read, thoſe young inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent children of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> did ſhew forth thy praiſe, not in ſpeaking as witneſſes; but in dying for thy names ſake, mortifie and kill all vices in us, that in our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, our life may expreſs thy faith, which with our tongues we do confeſs. And as thou wert pleaſed to teach the

And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt ordained and conſtituted the ſervices of all Angels and men in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful order, mercifully grant, that they which alway do thee ſervice in Heaven, may by thy appointment ſuccour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us in earth.

                        <p>And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.</p>
                        <p>As alſo there are not three incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibles, nor three uncreated: but one uncreated, and one incomprehenſible.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty: and the Holy Ghoſt Almighty.</p>
                        <p>And yet they are not three Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but one Almighty.</p>
                        <p>So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
                        <p>And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.</p>
                        <p>So likewiſe the Father is Lord, the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghoſt Lord.</p>
                        <p>And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.</p>
                        <p>For like as we be compelled by the Chriſtian verity: to acknowledge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon by himſelf to be God and Lord.</p>
                        <p>So are we forbidden by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170438:32"/> Religion: to ſay there be three Gods, or three Lords.</p>
                        <p>The Father is made of none: neither created nor begotten.</p>
                        <p>The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten.</p>
                        <p>The Holy Ghoſt is of the Father, and of the Son: neither made, nor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
                        <p>So there is one Father, not three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghoſt, not three Holy Ghoſts.</p>
                        <p>And in this Trinity, none is afore or after other: none is greater or leſs then another.</p>
                        <p>But the whole three perſons be coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal together: and coequal.</p>
                        <p>So that in all things, as is aforeſaid: the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worſhipped.</p>
                        <p>He therefore that will be ſaved: muſt thus think of the Trinity.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore it is neceſſary to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation: that he alſo believe rightly in the incarnation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>For the right faith is, that we believe and confeſs: that our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170438:33"/> Chriſt, the Son of God, is God and man.</p>
                        <p>God of the ſubſtance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and man of the ſubſtance of his mother born in the world.</p>
                        <p>Perfect God, and perfect man: of a reaſonable ſoul, and humane fleſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</p>
                        <p>Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead: and inferiour to the Father touching his manhood.</p>
                        <p>Who although he be God and man: yet he is not two, but one Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>One, not by converſion of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head into fleſh: but by taking the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood into God.</p>
                        <p>One altogether, not by confuſion of ſubſtance: but by unity of perſon.</p>
                        <p>For as the reaſonable ſoul and fleſh is one man: ſo God and man is one Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Who ſuffered for our ſalvation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Hell: roſe again the third day from the dead.</p>
                        <p>He aſcended into Heaven, he ſitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty: from whence he ſhall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170438:33"/> come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
                        <p>At whoſe coming all men ſhall riſe again with their bodies: and ſhall give account for their own works.</p>
                        <p>And they that have done good ſhall go into life everlaſting: and they that have done evil, into everlaſting fire.</p>
                        <p>This is the Catholick faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be ſaved.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>AT a certain time they brought Children to Chriſt, that he ſhould touch them; and his Diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought them. But when Jeſus ſaw it, he was diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for to ſuch belongeth the Kingdome of God. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, whoſoever doth not receive the Kingdome of God as a little Childe, he ſhall not enter therein. And when he had taken them up in his arms, he put his hands upon them and bleſſed them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Friends, you hear in this Goſpel the words of our Saviour Chriſt, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the children to be brought unto him: how he blamed thoſe that would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170438:41"/> have kept them from him, how he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all men to follow their innocencie. You perceive how by his outward geſture, and deed, he declared his good will toward them; for he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them and bleſſed them. Doubt you not therefore, but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly believe, that he will likewiſe favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably receive theſe preſent Infants, that he will embrace them with the arms of his mercy, that he will give unto them the bleſſing of Eternal life, and make them partakers of his everlaſting Kingdome. Wherefore we being thus perſwaded of the good will of our Heavenly Father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe infants, declared by his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and nothing doubting, but that he favourably alloweth this charitable work of ours in bringing theſe Children to his holy Baptiſme, let us proceed according<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in it.</p>
                        <p>Welbeloved friends, ye have brought theſe children here to be Baptized, ye have heard the gracious promiſe made by Chriſt unto them; which he for his part will moſt ſurely keep and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, wherefore theſe Infants muſt alſo faithfully for their part by you that be their

For as the benefit is great, if with a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart, and lively Faith, we receive that holy Sacrament, (for then we ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his blood: then we dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us: we be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us:) So is the danger great, if we receive the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170438:47"/> ſame unworthily; for then we be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt our Saviour: we eate and drinke our own judgement, not conſidering the Lords body. We kindle Gods wrath againſt us: We provoke him to plague us with divers diſeaſes, and ſundry kinds of death. Therefore if any of you be a blaſphemer of God, and hinderer or ſlaunderer of his word; an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other greivous crime, bewaile your ſins, and come not to this holy Table, leaſt the divell enter into you as he entred into <hi>Judas,</hi> and fill you full of all iniquities and bring you to deſtruction both of body and ſoule. Judge therefore your ſelves, bretheren, that ye be not judged of the Lord. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you truely of your ſins paſt; have a lively and ſtedfaſt Faith in Chriſt our Saviour: Amend your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men; So ſhall ye be meete partakers of thoſe holy myſteries. And, above all things, yee muſt give moſt humble and hearty thanks to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, for the redemption of the world,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170438:47"/> by the death and paſſion of our Saviour Chriſt, both God and man, who did humble himſelfe; even to the death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe, for us miſerable ſinners, which lay in darkneſs and ſhadow of death; that he might make us the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and exalt us unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. And to the end we ſhould alwayes remember the exceeding great love of our Maſter and only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits, which by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood ſhedding, he hath obtained to us. He hath inſtituted and ordained holy Myſteries as pledges of his love, and continuall remembrance of his death, to our great and endleſſe comfort. To him therefore, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, let us give as we are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, continuall thanks, ſubmitting our ſelves wholy to his holy will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and ſtudying to ſerve him in true holynes and righteouſnes all the dayes of our life.</p>

                        <p>ALmighty God, Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, maker of all things, judge of all men; wee acknowledge and bewaile our manifold ſinnes and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which we from time to time moſt grievouſly have committed, by thought, word, and deed, againſt thy Divine Majeſty, provoking moſt juſtly thy wrath and indignation againſt us. But we do earneſtly repent, and are heartily ſorry, for theſe our miſdoings; the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them is grievous unto us: the burthen of them is intolerable. Have mercy upon us, moſt mercifull Father, for thy Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake: forgive us all that is paſt; and grant that we may ever hereafter ſerve and pleaſe thee in newnes of life, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory of thy name. And (O Lord:) we do not preſume to come to this thy table, truſting in our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes; but in thy manifold and great mercies: We be not worthy ſo much as to gather up the crumbs under thy table. But thou art the ſame Lord, whoſe property
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170438:49"/> is alwayes to have mercy: We beſeech thee therefore gratious Lord, who of thy great mercy hath promiſed forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinns to all them, which with hearty repentance and true faith, turne unto thee; have mercy upon us, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and deliver us from all our ſinns, confirme, and ſtrengthen us in all goodneſs, and bring us to everlaſting life.</p>
                        <p>And O Lord, unto whom all hearts be open, all deſires known and from whom no ſecrets are hid, cleanſe the thoughts of our hearts by the inſpiration of thy holy ſpirit, that we may perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love thee and worthily magnify thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name.</p>
                        <p>And ſeeing it is meete, right and our bounden duty, that we ſhould at all times and in all places, lift up our hearts, even lift them up unto the Lord, in giving thanks, unto our Lord God, holy, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and Everlaſting Father, for all thy mercyes and bleſſings: So do we now more ſpecially prayſe thee, for thy Son and our Saviours incarnation, who by the operation of the holy Ghoſt, was made very man, of the ſubſtance of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170438:49"/> Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot of ſin, to make us cleane from all ſin. But chiefly we are bound to prayſe thee, for the glorious reſurrection of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord: for he is the very Paſchall Lambe, which was offered for us, and hath taken away the ſins of the world; who by his death hath deſtroyed death, and by his riſing to life againe, hath reſtored to us ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; Who alſo after his moſt glorious reſurrection, manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all his Apoſtles, and in their ſight, aſcended up into heaven, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for us, that where he is, thither might we alſo aſcend and reigne with him in glory: And we do alſo praiſe thee, for that according to his moſt true promiſe unto them, the holy Ghoſt came down from heaven, with a ſudden great ſound, as it had been a mighty wind, in the likeneſs of fiery tongues lighting upon the Apoſtles, to teach them, and to leade them into all truth, giving them both the gifts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers languages, and alſo boldneſs with ſervent zeale, conſtantly to preach the Goſpell unto all nations whereby we are,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170438:50"/> and have been brought out of darkneſs and errour, into the cleere light, and true knowledge of thee and thy Son, which art one God, one Lord, not one only perſon, but three perſons in one ſubſtance; by whom we have been taught that what we believe of the glory of the Father, the ſame we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, without any difference or inequality. For theſe ineſtimable benefits, we do with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Angells, and with all the company of heaven, laud and magnify thy glorious name, evermore prayſing thee and ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy</hi> Lord God of hoaſts, heaven and earth are full of thy glory.

                        <p>And, O Heavenly Father, who of thy tender mercy, didſt give thy only Son, Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuffer death upon the Croſs for our redemption; who made there (by his one oblation of himſelf once offered) a full, perfect, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſacrifice, oblation and ſatisfaction for the ſins of the whole world, and did inſtitute; and in his holy Goſpel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

And for what cauſe ſoever this ſickneſs is ſent unto you, whether it be to try your patience for the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that your faith may be found in the day of the Lord, laudable, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and honourable, to the encreaſe of glory and endleſs felicitie, or elſe it be ſent unto you, to correct and amend in you, whatſoever doth offend the eyes of your heavenly Father: know you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,

If ye be not under Correction (whereof all true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are partakers:) then are ye baſtards, and not children.

And there ſhould be no greater comfort to Chriſtian perſons, then to be made like unto Chriſt, by ſuffering patiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, troubles and ſickneſſes. For he himſelf went not up to joy, but firſt he ſuffered pain, he entred not into his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before he was crucified: ſo truly our way to eternal joy, is to ſuffer here with Chriſt, and our door to enter into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, is gladly to die with Chriſt, that we may riſe again from death, and dwell with him in everlaſting life. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking your ſickneſs which is thus profitable for you, patiently; I exhort you in the name of God, to remember the profeſſion, which you made unto God in your Baptiſme.

                        <p>IN thee, O Lord, have I put my truſt, let me never be put to confuſion: but rid me, and deliver me in thy righteouſneſs, incline thine ear unto me, and ſave me.</p>
                        <p>Be thou my ſtrong hold, whereunto I may alway reſort: thou haſt promiſed to help me, for thou art my houſe of defence, and my caſtle.</p>
                        <p>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>
                        <p>For thou O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope even from my youth.</p>
                        <p>Through thee have I been holden up ever ſince I was born: thou art he that took me out of my mothers womb, my praiſe ſhall be alway of thee.</p>
                        <p>I am become as it were a monſter unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but my ſure truſt is in thee.</p>
                        <p>O let my mouth be filled with thy praiſe:

                        <p>For mine enemies ſpeak againſt me, and they that lay wait for my ſoul, take their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel together, ſaying: God hath forſaken him, perſecute him, and take him, for there is none to deliver him.</p>
                        <p>Go not far from me, O God: my God, haſte thee to help me.</p>
                        <p>Let them be confounded and periſh, that are againſt my ſoul: let them be covered with ſhame and diſhonour, that ſeek to do me evil.</p>
                        <p>As for me, I will patiently abide alway: and will praiſe thee more and more.</p>
                        <p>My mouth ſhall dayly ſpeak of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſalvation: for I know no end thereof.</p>
                        <p>I will go forth in the ſtrength of the Lord God: and will make mention of thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only.</p>
                        <p>Thou (O God) haſt taught me from my youth up until now: therefore will I tell of thy wondrous works.</p>
                        <p>Forſake me not, O God, in mine old age, when I am gray headed, until I have ſhewed thy ſtrength unto this generation, and thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

                        <p>Thy righteouſneſs (O God) is very high, and great things are they that thou haſt done: O God, who is like unto thee?</p>
                        <p>O what great troubles and adverſities haſt thou ſhewed me, and yet didſt thou turn and refreſh me: yea, and broughteſt me from the deep of the earth again.</p>
                        <p>Thou haſt brought me to great honour: and comforted me on every ſide.</p>
                        <p>Therefore will I praiſe thee and thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs (O God) playing upon an inſtrument of muſick: unto thee will I ſing upon the harp, O thou holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Welbeloved, the ancient laudable order of our Church was, that as often as there was a marriage, there ſhould be a Sermon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ordinarily the duties of man and wife ſhould be declared according to holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but if there were no Sermon, it was left to the Miniſter to make this or ſome ſhort exhortation. I ſhall therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, firſt let you know what the holy Scripture doth ſay, as touching the duties of husbands towards their wives, and wives towards their husbands.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>SAint</hi> Paul <hi>in his Epiſtle to the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>the fifth Chapter,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 25.</note> 
                           <hi>doth give this commandment to all married men:</hi> Ye husbands love your wives, even as Chriſt loved the Church, and hath given himſelf for it, that he might ſo ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, that he might preſent it unto himſelf, a glorious Church,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170438:72"/> not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh. So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for no man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the Church: for we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and mother, and ſhall be joyned unto his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great myſtery; but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church. Nevertheleſs, let every one of you in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar love his wife, even as himſelf.</p>

                           <hi>Saint</hi> Paul <hi>(in the forenamed Epiſtle to the</hi> Epheſians) <hi>teacheth you thus:</hi> Ye women ſubmit your ſelves <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 22.</note> unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Chriſt is the head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the body.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt: ſo let the wives be to their own hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in all things. <hi>And again, he ſaith:</hi> Let the wife reverence her husband. <hi>And (in his Epiſtle to the</hi> Coloſsians) <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth you this ſhort leſſon:</hi> Ye wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>alſo, doth inſtruct you very godly, thus ſaying;</hi> Let wives be ſubject to their own husbands, ſo that if any obey not the word, they may without the word be wonne by the converſation of the wives, while they behold your chaſte converſation coupled with fear: whoſe adorning, let it not be that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adorning of platted hair, and wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170438:73"/> is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is a precious thing in the ſight of God. For after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (in the old time) did the holy women, which truſted in God, adorn themſelves, being in ſubjection to their own husbands, even as <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him Lord, whoſe daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and not being diſmayed with any fear. <hi>Theſe are your duties, which if you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that bleſſing in the 128.</hi> Pſalm <hi>may be your portion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BLeſſed are all they that fear the Lord, and walk in his wayes.</p>
                        <p>For thou ſhalt eat the labour of thy hands, O well is thee, and happy ſhalt thou be.</p>
                        <p>Thy wife ſhall be as the fruitful vine upon the walls of thine houſe.</p>
                        <p>Thy children like the olive branches, round about thy table.</p>
                        <p>Lo, thus ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord.</p>
                        <p>The Lord from out of Sion ſhall ſo bleſſe thee that thou ſhalt ſee Jeruſalem in proſperity all thy life long.</p>
                        <p>Yea, thou ſhalt ſee thy childrens children and peace upon Iſrael.</p>

                           <hi>Dearly beloved friends, we are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together here in the ſight of God, and in the face of his congregation, to joyn together this man and this woman, in holy matrimony, which is an honorable eſtate inſtituted of God in paradiſe, in the time of mans innocency; ſignifying unto us the myſticall union, that is betwixt Chriſt and his Church: which holy eſtate Chriſt adorned and beautified with his preſence, and firſt miracle that he wrought in Cana of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>to be honorable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men, and therefore is not to be enterpriſed, nor taken in hand unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, lightly or wantonly, to ſatisfie mens carnall luſts, and appetites like brute beaſts that have no underſtanding; but reverently, diſcreetly, adviſedly, ſoberly, and in the feare of God, duly conſidering the cauſes for which Matrimony was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. One was the procreation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to be brought up in the feare and nurture of the Lord, and praiſe of God. Secondly it was ordained for a remedy againſt ſinne, and to avoid fornication, that ſuch perſons as have not the giſt of continency, might marry, and keepe</hi>

O Lord, bleſs them both, and

But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">22</note> man in his own order. Chriſt the <note place="margin">23</note> firſt fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even the Father, <note place="margin">24</note> when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies <note place="margin">25</note> under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death. For he <note place="margin">26</note> hath put all things under his feet; but <note place="margin">27</note> when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be ſubject unto him that put all <note place="margin">28</note>
                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:170438:79"/> things under him, that God may be all in all. Elſe what ſhall they do, which <note place="margin">29</note> are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? Why are they then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the dead? And why ſtand <note place="margin">30</note> we in jeopardy every houre? I proteſt <note place="margin">31</note> by your rejoycing which I have in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, I die dayly. If after the manner of men, I have fought with <note place="margin">32</note> beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> what advantageth it me, if the dead riſe not? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die. Be not deceived: evil communications <note place="margin">33</note> corrupt good manners. Awake to righteouſneſs, and ſin not, for ſome <note place="margin">34</note> have not tbe knowledge of God, I ſpeak this to your ſhame. But ſome man will ſay, how are the dead raiſed up? And <note place="margin">35</note> with what body do they come? Thou fool, <note place="margin">36</note> that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned, except it die. And that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body which <note place="margin">37</note> ſhall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of ſome other grain. But God giveth it a body, as it hath pleaſed <note place="margin">38</note> him: and to every ſeed his own body. All fleſh is not the ſame fleſh, but there is one <note place="margin">39</note> kinde of fleſh of men, another fleſh of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170438:79"/> beaſts, another of fiſhes, and another of birds. There are alſo celeſtial bodies, and <note place="margin">40</note> hodies terreſtial: but the glory of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial is one, &amp; the glory of the terreſtrial is another. There is one glory of the ſun, <note place="margin">41</note> and another glory of the moon, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other glory of the ſtars: for one ſtar dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from another ſtar in glory. So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead, it <note place="margin">42</note> is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption. It is ſown in diſhonour, <note place="margin">43</note> it is raiſed in glory: it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power. It is <note place="margin">44</note> ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body. There is a natural body; and there is a ſpiritual body. And ſo <note place="margin">45</note> it is written, The firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living ſoul, the laſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickning ſpirit. Howbeit that was not firſt, which is ſpiritual: <note place="margin">46</note> but that which is natural, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is ſpiritual. The firſt man is of the earth, earthly: the ſecond <note place="margin">47</note> man is the Lord from heaven, heavenly. As is the earthly, ſuch are they that are <note place="margin">48</note> earthly: and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are heavenly. And <note place="margin">49</note> as we have born the image of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170438:80"/> we ſhall alſo bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I ſay, brethren, <note place="margin">50</note> that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God: neither doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption inherit incorruption. Behold I ſhew you a myſtery: we ſhall not all <note place="margin">51</note> ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, <note place="margin">52</note> at the laſt trump, for the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and we ſhall he changed. For this corruptible muſt put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <note place="margin">53</note> and this mortal, muſt put on immortality. So when this corruptible <note place="margin">54</note> ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory. O Death, where is thy <note place="margin">55</note> ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and tbe ſtrength <note place="margin">56</note> of ſin is the law. But thanks be to God, <note place="margin">57</note> which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, alwayes abounding in the work <note place="margin">58</note> of the Lord, for aſmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170438:86"/> of our conſultations, firſt look up unto thee (from whom wiſdome and happy ſucceſs doth come) praying thee, to look down from Heaven upon us with the eye of thy mercy; to draw near unto us with the preſence of thy grace: to prepare us all with counſel and underſtanding; and to be preſident, and director of all our conferences: that thoſe things may be propounded, conceived, allowed, and confirmed, which may beſt pleaſe thee, and moſt directly and ſoundly uphold the honour of thy Name, the ſincerity of thy worſhip; the ſafety of our King; and peace of thy people: even for thy Son our Lords ſake.</p>
                        <p>And that we may not our ſelves, be any hinderance to the obtaining of theſe our deſires, either by means of any Sin formerly committed, or of any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet remaining in us: we humbly pray thee, to forgive our ſins, and blot out all our iniquities: and to ſtand reconciled unto us, in an everlaſting covenant of peace, as if we had never ſinned againſt thee.</p>
                        <p>And, becauſe our hearts by nature are not fit for good cogitations; create a

                        <p>And if it ſhall chance the ſame Church, or any member thereof, to take any hurt or hinderance by reaſon of your negligence, ye know the greatneſs of the fault, and alſo of the horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which will enſue. Wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with your ſelves the end of your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie towards the children of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſpouſe and body of Chriſt, and ſee that you never ceaſe your labour, your care and diligence, until you have done all that lieth in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all ſuch as are or ſhall be committed unto your charge, unto that agreement in faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeneſs and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of age in Chriſt, that there be no place left among you, either of errour in religion, or for viciouſneſs in life.</p>
                        <p>Then, foraſmuch as your office is both of ſo great excellencie, and of ſo great difficulty, ye ſee with how great care and ſtudy ye ought to apply your ſelves, as well that you may ſhew your ſelves
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170438:94"/> kinde to that Lord who hath placed you in ſo high a dignity, as alſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that neither you your ſelves offend, neither be occaſion that other offend. Howbeit, ye cannot have a minde and a will thereto of your ſelves, for that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ability is given of God alone. Therefore ye ſee how ye ought and have need earneſtly to pray for his holy Spirit. And ſeeing that you cannot by any other means compaſs the doing of ſo weighty a work pertaining to the ſalvation of man, but with doctrine and exhortation taken out of the holy Scripture, and with a life agreeable unto the ſame: ye perceive how ſtudious ye ought to be in reading and in learning the Scriptures, and in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the manners, both of your ſelves, and of them that ſpecially pertain unto you, according to the rule of the ſame Scriptures: and for this ſelf ſame cauſe, ye ſee how ye ought to forſake and ſet aſide (as much as you may) all worldly cares and ſtudies.</p>
                        <p>We have good hope, that you have well weighed and pondered theſe things with your ſelves long before this time, and that you have clearly determined, by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170438:94"/> Gods grace, to give your ſelves wholly to this vocation, whereunto it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to call you, ſo that (as much as lyeth in you) you apply your ſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this one thing, and draw all your cares and ſtudies this way, and to this end. And that you will continually pray for the heavenly aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt from God the Father, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of our only mediatour and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, that by dayly reading and weighing of the Scriptures, ye may ſo wax riper and ſtronger in your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: and that ye may ſo endeavour your ſelves from time to time, to ſanctifie the lives of you and yours, and to faſhion them after the rule and doctrine of Chriſt: and that ye may be wholſome and godly examples and patterns for the reſt of the Congregation to follow: and that this preſent congregation of Chriſt here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, may alſo underſtand your mindes and wills in theſe things: and that this your promiſe ſhall more move you to do your duties, ye ſhall anſwer plainly to theſe things, which we in the name of the congregation ſhall demand of you touching the ſame.</p>

Wherefore they which be indued with ſo excellent a benefit of God, be called according to Gods purpoſe by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon: they through grace obey the calling: they be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely: they be made ſons of God by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they be made like the Image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt: they walk religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in good works, and at length by Gods mercy they attain to everlaſting felicity.</p>
                  <p>As the godly conſideration of Predeſtination and our Election in Chriſt is full of ſweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and unſpeakable comfort to godly perſons, and ſuch as feel in themſelves the working of the ſpirit of Chriſt mortifying the works of the fleſh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minde to high and heavenly things, as well becauſe it doth greatly eſtabliſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their faith of eternal ſalvation, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed through Chriſt, as becauſe it doth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently kindle their love towards God: ſo for
